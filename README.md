**Sentinel** acts as an intermediary protection layer for smart contracts by integrating: <br>
<br> ‚úÖ A **Smart Contract Firewall** for real-time attack detection. <br>
‚úÖ A **Decentralized Auditing Network** using AI & ZK-Proofs. <br>
‚úÖ A Private Mempool & **MEV-Resistant** Execution Layer for front-running protection. <br>
‚úÖ **Self-Healing Smart Contracts** that autonomously detect and stop exploits. <br>
‚úÖ Confidential Execution for sensitive DeFi and governance operations. <br>

## Features

üîê Core Security Features

   - Smart Contract Firewall ‚Äì Blocks malicious transactions before execution.
   - AI-Powered Audits ‚Äì Uses machine learning for continuous vulnerability detection.
   - Self-Healing Smart Contracts ‚Äì Auto-rollback and patching for exploited contracts.

‚ö° MEV-Resistant Execution Layer

   - Private Mempools ‚Äì Encrypts transactions to prevent MEV attacks.
   - Fair Transaction Ordering ‚Äì Uses cryptography to eliminate front-running.
   - Batch Execution Mechanism ‚Äì Reduces MEV risks and ensures fair trade execution.

üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Threat Protection

   - Decentralized Security Oracles ‚Äì On-chain risk scoring and anomaly detection.
   - Rug Pull Protection ‚Äì Detects and blocks unauthorized liquidity withdrawals.
   - Immutable Threat Intelligence Database ‚Äì Stores past exploits to prevent repeat attacks.

üìä Security Analytics & Reporting

   - Real-Time Security Dashboards ‚Äì Monitors contract health and active threats.
   - On-Chain Reputation Scoring ‚Äì Assigns risk ratings to contracts and protocols.
   - Developer Security Toolkit ‚Äì Includes static analysis, fuzzing, and formal verification tools.

‚öôÔ∏è Integration & Governance

   - Multi-Chain Support ‚Äì Compatible with L2 rollups (Arbitrum, zkSync, StarkNet).
   - On-Chain Governance ‚Äì Community-driven security upgrades and bounty distribution.
   - Bug Bounty & White Hat Incentives ‚Äì Encourages responsible vulnerability disclosure.
