**Sentinel** acts as an intermediary protection layer for smart contracts by integrating: <br>
<br> ✅ A **Smart Contract Firewall** for real-time attack detection. <br>
✅ A **Decentralized Auditing Network** using AI & ZK-Proofs. <br>
✅ A Private Mempool & **MEV-Resistant** Execution Layer for front-running protection. <br>
✅ **Self-Healing Smart Contracts** that autonomously detect and stop exploits. <br>
✅ Confidential Execution for sensitive DeFi and governance operations. <br>

## Features

🔐 Core Security Features

   - Smart Contract Firewall – Blocks malicious transactions before execution.
   - AI-Powered Audits – Uses machine learning for continuous vulnerability detection.
   - Self-Healing Smart Contracts – Auto-rollback and patching for exploited contracts.

⚡ MEV-Resistant Execution Layer

   - Private Mempools – Encrypts transactions to prevent MEV attacks.
   - Fair Transaction Ordering – Uses cryptography to eliminate front-running.
   - Batch Execution Mechanism – Reduces MEV risks and ensures fair trade execution.

🛡️ Advanced Threat Protection

   - Decentralized Security Oracles – On-chain risk scoring and anomaly detection.
   - Rug Pull Protection – Detects and blocks unauthorized liquidity withdrawals.
   - Immutable Threat Intelligence Database – Stores past exploits to prevent repeat attacks.

📊 Security Analytics & Reporting

   - Real-Time Security Dashboards – Monitors contract health and active threats.
   - On-Chain Reputation Scoring – Assigns risk ratings to contracts and protocols.
   - Developer Security Toolkit – Includes static analysis, fuzzing, and formal verification tools.

⚙️ Integration & Governance

   - Multi-Chain Support – Compatible with L2 rollups (Arbitrum, zkSync, StarkNet).
   - On-Chain Governance – Community-driven security upgrades and bounty distribution.
   - Bug Bounty & White Hat Incentives – Encourages responsible vulnerability disclosure.

## FAQ

### 🔹 What is Sentinel?  
Sentinel is a comprehensive smart contract security platform that provides multi-layer protection against various types of attacks and exploits. It combines advanced technologies like AI-powered audits, zero-knowledge proofs, and private mempool execution to create a robust security framework for DeFi applications and smart contracts.  

### 🔹 Why do I need Sentinel for my smart contracts?  
Smart contracts require robust security measures due to their exposure to potential exploits and financial risks. Over **$120+ million** was lost to hacks in recent years [check here](https://blog.openzepplin.com), highlighting the critical need for automated security solutions. Sentinel helps prevent such losses by providing real-time attack detection and automated response mechanisms.  

### 🔹 What kind of support does Sentinel offer?  
Sentinel offers multiple support channels, including:  
- 📚 **Documentation**  
- 🌐 **Website**  
- 📦 **Pip integration, Yarn integration, and Docker integration**  
- 📖 **Wiki for the project**  
- 🌍 **Socials**  

### 🔹 What makes Sentinel's auditing system unique?  
Sentinel combines **artificial intelligence** with **zero-knowledge proofs** to create a **decentralized auditing network**. This system continuously monitors contracts for vulnerabilities while maintaining privacy through cryptographic techniques, ensuring comprehensive security **without exposing sensitive information**.
